An AngularJS-based reader of OPDS feeds.

OPDS — the Open Publication Distribution System — is an Atom-based feed that publishers can use to represent the books they publish. As with a blog and its Atom feed, a publisher's list is continuously adding new items and updating existing ones.

This app was built using the AngularJS JavaScript framework and includes the core feeds of the web's largest free e-book publisher, Feedbooks. The app makes use of Bootstrap's responsive design so that the layout adjusts appropriately to tablets (ideal for reading), mobile phones, and laptop and desktop screens.
